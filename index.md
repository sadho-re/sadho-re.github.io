# Healing psoriasis Naturally (or any disease)

# Introduction
I am writing this guide as many people expressed interest in how I reverted my psoriasis using only diet, yoga and meditation. I believe a lots of information in this guide applies to other auto-immune diseases as well.
I had psoriasis first time that started in 2012 and i went through all types of medication to control it. Only in 2020 when lockdown started I left out all the medicines and took the natural approach and within 3 months all the patches were gone. After so much success I went back to my previous lifestyle and it came back with vengenace. I have again started following the same principles and 100% sure that psoriasis can be cured.

I dont have anything to sell and only want to share my knowledge and experience that I accumulated through years of managing the disease and extensive reading.

## The Principles
All auto-immune diseases starts with the stomach. Unhealthy food causes the toxin buildups, which disturbs the gut flora, make the intestines poros(leaky gut). Because of the damage in the internal linings of the intestine, foreign elements skip to blood which should not be present in our blood and lymph systems at all. Our immune system gets overactive to fight this and the result is the inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Scientists are also now discovring the role our gut microbiome plays in seemingly unrelated complications like ADHD, depression and variety of mental disorders.

The food that we eat is not the food our ancestors used to eat and our body has not acclimatized with the variety of food and drinks we put in our stomach. The result of this is the buildup of toxins, porosity of the gut, and reduced health of the gut flora. This continuous abuse of our body will express itself in diseases and which disease it will find expression in depends on individuals. For me it was psoriasis, for others it maybe arthritis, diabetes, cancer and variety of other diseases.

The whole regime that I followed was meant to stop this abuse and supporting the body to heal itself from within. There are 3 basic principles to this regime.

## 1. Cleaning
The very first part of the regime involves the cleaning of the toxins that are builtup in our circulatory system, lymph systems. All food consumed should be expelled in maximum 24 hours period. There are 2 things that i followed for 15 initial days of my regime to clean the system.
* Enema - every morning empty stomach after going to toilet. Use only clean water.
* Wet Packs - wet cloth with cold water(12 inch wide) tied on stomach with naval in between. Another piece on neck and head. The difference in temperature in our body because of this causes toxins to come out.

These two for intial 15 days will bring the much required cleaning for years of toxins builtup in our body. Again use common sense to use these methods. If you live in a very cold climate, maybe dont use the ice cold water for wet packs else you will get cold. Enema can be skipped for a day or two if you find any discomfort. You can still use enema once in a week if you feel constipated. But it shouldnt be made into a habit. 

## 2. Diet
Its the most important part and will decide whether you remain disease free all your life or not. These changes are lifestyle changes and are the most difficult to maintain over a long period of time. Unless you are free of the disease make sure to follow them religiously and afterwards you can eat other things as well but try to follow the principles of good food.

The food should be easy to digest, high in nutrient, fibre-rich(for good elimination), free of harsh chemicals and in its natural form ( no processed food ). Eat lots of seasonal fruits, vegetables in its natural form. You can blanch vegetables or half cook them. I used to eat a large bowl of apples with spinach, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, lemon juice and little salt as my first meal at 12.30PM. No tea/coffee, alcohol, cigarattes or sugary drink and no fruit juices as well. Eat a fruit instead. Any seasonal fruit is fine that you can find in your store. Seasonal fruits are cheap and can be eaten in large quantities. 

Avoid eating carbs and specially wheat. It will work wonders for you. Eat complex carbs that you can find in millets. I will soak some pearl millets overnight and will make porridge of it with whatever vegetable I can find(bottle gourd, okra, tomatoes). I will cook it in Desi ghee with cumin and turmeric powder and salt and eat as my 2 meals at 2PM and 8PM.

Don't worry about the various parameter like vitamins, carbs, minerals etc. If you have weak intestines and poor absorption and disturbed gut flora, no matter how nutrient rich food you eat, it will go down the toilet. Following raw diet will improve your digestion and you will be able to take out more nutrients from the food that you eat.

### Fasting
Ayurveda says - लंघनं परम् औषधं meaning fasting is the greatest medicine. You will notice that all animals when ill stops eating immediately but we humans have lost all sense of what is good and bad for ourselves. When we eat, the prana(energy that keeps us alive and healthy) gets involved in digesting the food. During rest/sleep this same energy repairs the body. If we keep ourselves stuffed all the time the prana doesn't get the time to do its healing work as digestion always takes priority.

I used to do intermittent fasting of 16 hours minimum everyday - meaning if I ate dinner at 8PM the next meal I will eat at after 12PM next day. And the first meal was always lots of fruits with leafy vegetables pumpkin and flax seeds. Sprinkle some lemon and black salt to make it tastier. Apart from this I will do full fasting whenever I felt like. For 24/48/72 hours no food, only water. You can add some lemon and salt to water once or twice in a day to makeup for the lost salt through urination and sweating. Believe me no one has ever died by not eating 2 or 3 days. There are people who have gone on water fasting for a month as well and they are healthy and nothing bad happens. I would suggest intermittent fasting everyday and after a month in this regime try fasting for 24 hours or 48 hours. A 3 day water fast is recommended every month, if you want to get better early and easily.

## 3. Yoga and Meditation
 Light exercise is needed untill you are disease free. You dont want to stress your body too much by going to gym. It will cause you more harm. Yoga is the right exercise for this. These are rhythmic, light exercises that work on both body and mind. You dont need any equipments. Only a mat and a peaceful place is enough. Here is what I used to do every morning-
 
 * 15 minutes of Surya Namaskar(sun salutation) - 6 rounds slowly (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jagerDevelop.Yoga). This is the app I use to track. You will find details on youtube
 * Asana - Ardh Matsyendrasana, Bharadwaj Asana, Mandukasana - These are all twisting asanas that greatly helps in re vitalizing internal organs like liver, kidney, pancreas and flushing out toxins from them. Its important to remain in position as long as you are comfortable and do few rounds of each. Please make sure you remain comfortable and do them slowly and rhytmically.
 * Breathing Exercises - Kapalbhati(5 minutes), Nadi Shodhan(10 minutes - can be increased to 15 or 20 minutes as well) Very very important. These will work on parasympthatic nervous system and will bring your body mind into rest and peace. This is when the body heals itself at rapid rate. I will even say that if you are short of time dont do the above 2 but make sure to do it.
* Om Chanting - 21 times - you start with aaa uuuuuu mmmmmm. The vibrations should start from the lower abdomen and as you end with mmmm sound the vibration should end up in your head. It should travel all the region between your lower abdomen and your head. If you can do it for 30 days, you will notice a new sense of rejuvenation in your stomach. You will feel your stomach alive, your digestion and elimination will get improved.
* Vashishta Pranayam - This is the resting phase
* Meditation - You can meditate for some time now if you feel like. Else do it before you go to sleep everyday.

# Last Words
Lifestyle diseases always have a mental aspects associated with them. Keep the positive attitude. Learn to see the positive aspect in every situation. You will never feel disheartened, demotivated. There are people who have worse than you and you should be thankful that you have a lot better than many of the human beings. The disease don't define you. You don't need to hide off in the corner. Forgive yourself for the past things, accept yourself as you are. Go out, take a walk in nature, do some work in soil( do you know the children who play in dirt have better gut flora than those who never go out? )

This regime is very simple. After 15 days of cleaning you only need 1 to 2 hour daily for exercise and meditation and the diet changes. Please note that all of the 3 steps defined above starts together. And dont feel disheartened if you don't see the results soon. Remember that it will take some time to revert the years of abuse. Once the body switches into the recovery mode, you will be surprised how fast it can heal itself. When I started this regime I only saw the minimal improvement for the first month. At the end of the first month I did a 3 day water fast and within next 15 days my skin was cleared 50%. By the end of 3 months not a single lesion was there and the color of the skin was improving as well.
