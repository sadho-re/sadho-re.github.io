# Healing psoriasis Naturally (or any disease)

# Introduction
I am writing this guide as many people expressed interest in how I reverted my psoriasis using only diet, yoga and meditation. I believe a lots of information in this guide applies to other auto-immune diseases as well.
I had psoriasis first time that started in 2012 and i went through all types of medication to control it. Only last year i left out all the medicines and took the natural approach and within 3 months all the patches were gone.After so much success I went back to my previous lifestyle and it came back with vengenace. I have again started following the same principles and plan to update you guys with the photographs of progress I am making in real time.

I dont have anything to sell and only want to share my knowledge and experience that I accumulated through years of managing the disease and extensive reading.

## The Principles
All auto-immune diseases starts with the stomach. I even dare to claim that 90% of diseases starts from the stomach. Scientists are also now discovring the role our gut microbiome plays in seemingly unrelated complications like ADHD, depression and variety of mental disorders.

The food that we eat is not the food our ancestors used to eat and our body has not acclimatized with the variety of food and drinks we put in our stomach. The result of this is the buildup of toxins, porosity of the gut, and reduced health of the gut flora. The continuous abuse of our body will express itself in diseases and which disease it will find expression in depends on individuals. For me it was psoriasis, for others it maybe arthritis, diabetes, cancer and variety of other diseases.

The whole regime that I followed was designed on stopping this abuse and support the body to heal itself from within.

## 1. Cleaning
The very first part of the regime involves the cleaning of the toxins that are builtup in our circulatory system, lymph systems. All food consumed should be expelled in maximum 24 hours period. There are 2 things that i followed for 15 initial days of my regime to clean the system.
* Enema - every morning empty stomach after going to toilet. Use only clean water.
* Wet Packs - wet cloth with cold water(12 inch wide) tied on stomach with naval in between. Another piece on neck and head. The difference in temperature in our body because of this causes toxins to come out.

These two for intial 15 days will bring the much required cleaning for years of toxins builtup in our body. Again use common sense to use these methods. If you live in a very cold climate, maybe dont use the ice cold water for wet packs else you will get cold. Enema can be skipped for a day or two if you find any discomfort. You can still use enema once in a week if you feel constipated. But it shouldnt be made into a habit. 

## 2. Diet
Its the most important part and will decide whether you remain disease free all your life or not. These changes are lifestyle changes and are the most difficult to maintain over a long period of time. Unless you are free of the disease make sure to follow them religiously and afterwards you can eat other things as well but try to follow the principles of good food.

The food should be easy to digest, high in nutrient, fibre-rich(for good elimination), free of harsh chemicals and in its natural form ( no processed food ). Eat lots of seasonal fruits, vegetables in its natural form. You can blanch vegetables or half cook them. I used to eat a large bowl of apples with pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, lemon juice and little salt as my first meal at 12.30PM. No tea/coffee, alcohol, cigarattes or sugary drink and no fruit juices as well. Eat a fruit instead. Any seasonal fruit is fine that you can find in your store. Seasonal fruits are cheap and can be eaten in large quantities. 

Avoid eating carbs and specially wheat. It will work wonders for you. Eat complex carbs that you can find in millets. I will soak some pearl millets overnight and will make porridge of it with whatever vegetable I can find(bottle gourd, okra, tomatoes). I will cook it in Desi ghee with cumin and turmeric powder and salt and eat as my 2 meals at 2PM and 8PM.

### Fasting
Ayurveda says - लंघनं परम् औषधं meaning fasting is the greatest medicine. You will notice that all animals when ill stops eating immediately but we humans have lost all sense of what is good and bad for ourselves. When we eat, the prana(energy that keeps us alive and healthy) gets involved in digesting the food. During sleep this same energy repairs the body. If we keep ourselves stuffed all the time the prana doesnt get the time to do its healing work as digestion always takes priority.

I used to do intermittent fasting of 16 hours minimum everyday - meaning if I ate dinner at 8PM the next meal I will eat at after 12PM next day. And the first meal was always lots of fruits with pumpkin and flax seeds. Sprinkle some lemon and black salt to make it tastier. Apart from this I will do full fasting whenever i felt like. For 48 hours no food, only water. You can add some lemon and salt to water once or twice in a day to makeup for the lost salt through urination and sweating. Believe me no one has ever died by not eating 2 or 3 days. There are people who have gone on water fasting for a month as well and they are healthy and nothing bad happens. I would suggest intermittent fasting everyday and after a month in this regime try fasting for 24 hours or 48 hours. A 3 day water fast is must every month, if you want to get better early and easily.
